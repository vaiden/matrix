# The Matrix

This repository is www.mypdns.org self maintained list of domains that
needs to be blocked for various reasons.

# Source list
The `source` folder contains several sub-folders, each named as groups,
for which a submission should be put. This however doesn't necessary
mean that one domain can't be put into several 'groups'

Ex. `google.*` which belongs to several groups as they represents all
online evil, when we talks privacy and anti brainwash/manipulation;
Facebook is also well represented in several categories.

# Categorising
Each sub-folder of `sources` should contain it's own README which in
short describe what the list is all about and criteria to add a domain
into it's `domain.list` or `wildcard.list`

# Whitelist
This list have it's very own life, as this is a very very tricky one to
maintain.

The reason for that is, it have to balance between what is going on with
a domain that for several reasons might be blacklisted on some lists
but not on others. It can also be that a domain in general do 99,9%
right, but because of it's nature of user based submissions, could do a
lot of evil.

##### Ex. Gitlab.com

Gitlab is hosting 100% user submitted contents, but for the same reason also a
widely target for cyber criminals to host there evil
[Malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware). For that rightfully
reason Gitlab often pop ups on list for malicious code. But as that
would have a huge influence on our workflow, it would of curse have to be
whitelisted on our list.
